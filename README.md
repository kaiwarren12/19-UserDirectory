## Description
For this assignment, I created an employee directory with React. This assignment will break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. This is done by being able to sort through and filter within our employee directory. 

## User Story

 As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

### Installation
1. Clone repository
2. npm install dependencies
3. npm start

### Usage
![Demo](reactApp.mp4)
